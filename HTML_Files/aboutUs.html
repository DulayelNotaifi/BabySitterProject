        <h2>Who we are:</h2>
        <p class="aboutPar">  We are Aliyah, Nuha, Dulayel, Cady, and Lena, a group of friends and the founders of "A Watchful Eye". Founded in 2022, 
            A Watchful Eye is a trusted service for parents and families which aims to simplify the search for a babysitter. Parents can instantly book a trusted, reliable babysitter using our website. The team here at A Watchful Eye are a friendly and committed bunch who know what itâ€™s like to be a busy parent.
            We understand the pressures on parents and how important it is to find good help so that you can work or do anything, knowing that your children are in good hands.
            We also want to support those in our community who are looking for work in the childcare industry. We want to help them find meaningful work where their valuable experience and skills are appreciated.
            So we created A Watchful Eye, a free online babysitting directory for parents and babysitters to connect.
